# Scheduled Tasks

Agent Swarm supports cron-based scheduling to automate recurring tasks. Schedules automatically create tasks at specified intervals.

## Creating a Schedule

```
create-schedule(
  name: "daily-standup",
  taskTemplate: "Generate a daily standup report summarizing yesterday's completed tasks",
  cronExpression: "0 9 * * *",
  timezone: "America/New_York"
)
```

Or use interval-based scheduling:

```
create-schedule(
  name: "health-check",
  taskTemplate: "Check all services are healthy and report any issues",
  intervalMs: 3600000
)
```

## Schedule Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique name for the schedule |
| `taskTemplate` | Task description created each time |
| `cronExpression` | Cron expression (e.g., `0 9 * * *` for daily at 9 AM) |
| `intervalMs` | Alternative: interval in milliseconds |
| `timezone` | Timezone for cron schedules (default: UTC) |
| `targetAgentId` | Agent to assign tasks to (omit for task pool) |
| `priority` | Task priority 0-100 (default: 50) |
| `tags` | Tags applied to created tasks |
| `taskType` | Type classification for created tasks |
| `enabled` | Whether the schedule is active (default: true) |

## Managing Schedules

### List Schedules

```
list-schedules()
list-schedules(enabled: true)
list-schedules(name: "daily")
```

### Update a Schedule

```
update-schedule(name: "daily-standup", cronExpression: "0 10 * * *")
update-schedule(name: "daily-standup", enabled: false)
```

### Delete a Schedule

```
delete-schedule(name: "daily-standup")
```

### Run Immediately

Trigger a scheduled task now without waiting for the next interval:

```
run-schedule-now(name: "daily-standup")
```

This creates a task immediately but does not affect the regular schedule timing.

## Cron Expression Examples

| Expression | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `0 9 * * *` | Every day at 9:00 AM |
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9:00 AM |
| `*/30 * * * *` | Every 30 minutes |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Every Sunday at midnight |
| `0 9,17 * * *` | At 9 AM and 5 PM daily |

## How Scheduling Works

The MCP server runs a scheduler that polls for due schedules at a configurable interval (default: 10 seconds, set via `SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS`).

When a schedule is due:
1. A new task is created with the schedule's `taskTemplate`
2. If `targetAgentId` is set, the task is assigned to that agent
3. Otherwise, the task goes into the unassigned pool
4. The schedule's `lastRunAt` is updated

Only the schedule creator or the lead agent can update or delete schedules.
