3. Generate a webhook secret

## Configuration

```bash
# Required for GitHub webhooks
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret

# Optional: Bot name for @mentions (default: agent-swarm-bot)
GITHUB_BOT_NAME=your-bot-name

# Optional: Enable bot reactions (requires GitHub App)

## Supported Events

| Event | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| Bot assigned to PR/issue | Creates a task for the lead agent |
| Review requested from bot | Creates a review task |
| `@bot-name` in comment/issue/PR | Creates a task with the mention context |
| PR review submitted (on bot's PR) | Creates a notification task with review feedback |
| CI failure (on PRs with existing tasks) | Creates a CI notification task |

## Bot Reactions

If GitHub App credentials are provided (`GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`), the bot can react to comments and issues with emoji to acknowledge receipt.

## Worker Git Configuration

Workers need git credentials to create PRs and push code:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token    # For git operations
GITHUB_EMAIL=worker@desplega.ai   # Git commit email
GITHUB_NAME=Worker Agent           # Git commit name
```
