# Epics

Epics are a way to organize related tasks into larger projects. They provide a high-level view of progress across multiple tasks.

## Creating an Epic

```
create-epic(
  name: "auth-system-revamp",
  goal: "Replace the legacy auth system with JWT-based authentication",
  description: "Full rewrite of the authentication module...",
  plan: "## Phase 1\n- Task A\n- Task B\n\n## Phase 2\n..."
)
```

## Epic Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique name for the epic |
| `goal` | The objective this epic achieves |
| `description` | Detailed description |
| `plan` | Implementation plan (markdown) |
| `prd` | Product Requirements Document (markdown) |
| `status` | `draft`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `priority` | 0-100 (default: 50) |
| `tags` | Labels for filtering |
| `leadAgentId` | Agent responsible for this epic |
| `planDocPath` | Path to a plan document in the repo |
| `researchDocPath` | Path to a research document |

## Managing Tasks in Epics

### Assigning Tasks to Epics

When creating a task, associate it with an epic:

```
send-task(task: "Implement JWT token generation", epicId: "epic-uuid")
```

Or assign an existing task:

```
assign-task-to-epic(taskId: "task-uuid", epicName: "auth-system-revamp")
```

### Removing Tasks from Epics

```
unassign-task-from-epic(taskId: "task-uuid")
```

The task is kept but no longer associated with the epic.

## Tracking Progress

Use `get-epic-details` to see progress:

- Total tasks in the epic
- Tasks by status (completed, in progress, pending, etc.)
- Overall completion percentage

## GitHub Integration

Epics can be linked to GitHub:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `githubRepo` | Repository identifier (e.g., `desplega-ai/agent-swarm`) |
| `githubMilestone` | GitHub milestone to track progress |

## Slack Integration

Epics can have a dedicated Slack thread:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `slackChannelId` | Slack channel for updates |
| `slackThreadTs` | Thread timestamp for conversation |

## Epic Lifecycle

1. **Draft** — Epic is being planned, tasks are being defined
2. **Active** — Work is in progress on the epic's tasks
3. **Paused** — Work is temporarily on hold
4. **Completed** — All tasks are done, epic goals achieved
5. **Cancelled** — Epic was abandoned
