# Sentry Integration

Docker workers include `sentry-cli` pre-installed, enabling agents to investigate and triage Sentry issues directly.

## Setup

1. Create an Organization Auth Token at `https://sentry.io/settings/{org}/auth-tokens/` with scopes:
   - `event:read` — Read issues and events
   - `project:read` — Read project data
   - `org:read` — Read organization info

2. Add to your worker environment:

```bash
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
SENTRY_ORG=your-org-slug
```

3. Verify authentication in a worker:

```bash
sentry-cli info
```

## Usage

Workers can use the `/investigate-sentry-issue` command to:
- Get issue details and stacktraces
- Analyze breadcrumbs and context
- Resolve, mute, or unresolve issues

### Examples

```
/investigate-sentry-issue https://sentry.io/organizations/myorg/issues/123456/
```

Or just the issue ID:

```
/investigate-sentry-issue 123456
```
